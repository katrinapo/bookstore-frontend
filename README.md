# Book Central Angular Application

Book Central is an application that allows customers to rent books at an affordable cost, allowing them to read trending books without having to pay full retail prices. It allows for two types of users, customers and employees. The customers are able to browse available books and select them to be rented. Employees are able to update the book inventory, by adding or editing books. The are also able to view customer orders and approve them accordingly.
